->MERN Application Containerization

.This project demonstrates the containerization of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application using Docker.
.The goal was to package the entire full-stack application into lightweight, portable containers for consistent deployment across environments.

 
->Key Highlights

.Created Dockerfiles for both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js + Express).

.Used Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers (frontend, backend, and MongoDB).

.Configured networking between services to enable smooth communication.

.Optimized image layers for faster builds and smaller image sizes.

.Verified the setup by accessing the running application through a containerized environment.

->Tech Stack

.Frontend: React

.Backend: Node.js, Express.js

.Database: MongoDB (containerized)

.Tools: Docker, Docker Compose
